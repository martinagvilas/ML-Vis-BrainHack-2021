    "# Some important concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly review some conceptual distinctions in Machine Learning (ML). This section is a refresher. If you are lacking some knowledge on these concepts, please consult our suggested reading in [Notebook 1](./01-preliminaries.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What machine learning is about\n",
    "An excellent working definition of ML can be found in [Tal Yarkoni's tutorial](https://github.com/neurohackademy/nh2020-curriculum/blob/master/tu-machine-learning-yarkoni/02-core-concepts.ipynb): ML is the field of science/engineering that seeks to build systems capable of learning from experience. The goal of ML is to develop algorithms that can learn from data with a minimum set of explicitly programmed rules on how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of ML models depending on how they learn from data: supervised and unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised ML\n",
    "In supervised ML, we have available the real values of the variables we want to predict. The model can then use this information to train itself by comparing its predicted values with the real ones using a __loss function__, and use an __optimization algorithm__ to iteratively make small adjustments and improve its perfomance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression vs classification\n",
    "Supervised learning models can also be divided into regression and classification tasks. Regression models seek to predict a continuous variable (e.g. age), while classification models predict discrete labels (e.g. wine class).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised ML\n",
    "In unsupervised ML, these labels are unkown. The algorithm instead seeks to find a pattern in the data that might be useful.\n"

That means, both supervised (classification or regression) and unsupervised models can be constructed and fitted using estimators. We will review some properties of estimators in _scikit-learn_ using an example for each of these types of models.\n"

    "\n",
    "For example, if we had a feature matrix $X$ contaning the values of features $x1$ and $x2$, the value $\\hat{y}$ predicted by linear regression could be expressed as:\n",
